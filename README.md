I'm old to IT, but new-ish to github. I've used github to find much software in the past, but have never added anything.
I'm now a student once again, and will be using this to hold all my coursework. I'm enrolled in the Data Management/Data Analytics program at WGU.
I'm currently learning C++, Python, R, MongoDB, etc.
I have been a Systems Engineer for the Cloudera platform for @ 7 years.
Here's to the fun!
